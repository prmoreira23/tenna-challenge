## Software Development Problems
### Optimized Math
This program should be a short piece of code that prints all of the positive integers from 1 to 100 as described more fully
below. The program may contain multiple methods, and if using an OO language, should be contained within a single class
or object. The program should be designed so that it begins execution when invoked through whichever mechanism is most
common for the implementation language.

### Thread Synchronization
This program may be written in the language of your choosing, but must be written in a language
that supports multithreading. This program should output all of the positive integers from 1 to 100. Internally, the program
must use two threads; one thread that prints odd numbers and another thread that prints even numbers. Furthermore,
these two threads must be synchronized such that the output appears in correct numerical order. The program may contain
multiple methods, and if using an OO language, the program should be contained within a single class or object.
